# DigitalFabrication
The project idea is using capacitive sensor as input signal to open a mechanical flower with Arduino. Arduino will play a song after that.
# Arduino code for
## Servo: 
- We use Servo.h to control the Servo https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Servo

## Melody:
- We convert the song into notes and play it with tone and noTone https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/advanced-io/tone/

## Capacitive Sensor:
- A copper plate is used as input. If someone touches the copper, the capacity will be sensed by Arduino with CapacitiveSensor: https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/CapacitiveSensor?from=Main.CapSense
